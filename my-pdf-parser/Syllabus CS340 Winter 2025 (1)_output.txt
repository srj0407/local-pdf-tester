Guidelines for a Productive and EƯective Online Classroom
Students are expected to conduct themselves in the course (e.g., on discussion boards, email) in compliance with the university’s regulations regarding civility. Civility is an essential ingredient for academic discourse. All communications for this course should be conducted constructively, civilly, and respectfully. DiƯerences in beliefs,
opinions, and approaches are to be expected. In all you say and do for this course, be professional. Please bring any communications you believe to be in violation of this class policy to the attention of your instructor. Active interaction with peers and your instructor is essential to success in this online course, paying particular attention to the following:  Unless indicated otherwise, please complete the readings and view other instructional materials for each week before participating in the discussion board.
 Read your posts carefully before submitting them.
 Be respectful of others and their opinions, valuing diversity in backgrounds, abilities, and experiences.
 You may challenge the ideas held by others as part of critical thinking and the academic process if you are courteous and respectful. Please word your responses carefully and recognize that others may interpret what you say diƯerently than you expect. A positive atmosphere of collegiality and mutual support is
encouraged in the learning process.
Academic Integrity The Code of Student Conduct prohibits Academic Misconduct and defines it as: Any action that misrepresents a student or group’s work, knowledge, or achievement, provides a potential or actual inequitable advantage, or compromises the integrity of the educational process. To support understanding of what can be included in this definition, the Code further classifies and describes examples of Academic Misconduct, as follows. Prohibited behaviors include, but are not limited to doing or attempting the following actions:  Harassment. Repeated, persistent, severe, or pervasive actions... directed toward specific individual(s) with the intent or eƯect to harass, harm, or alarm.
 Cheating. Unauthorized assistance, or access to or use of unauthorized materials, information, tools, or study aids. Examples include, but are not limited to, unauthorized collaboration or copying on a test or assignment, using prohibited materials and texts, unapproved use of cell phones, internet, or other electronic devices, etc.

 Plagiarism. Representing the words or ideas of another person or presenting someone else’s words, data, expressed ideas, or artistry as one’s own. Examples include, but are not limited to, presenting someone else’s opinions and theories as one’s own, using another person’s work or words (including unpublished material) without appropriate source documentation or citation, working jointly on a project and then submitting it as one’s own, etc.
 Falsification. Fabrication or invention of any information. Examples include, but are not limited to, falsifying research, inventing or falsely altering data, citing fictitious references, falsely recording or reporting attendance, hours, or engagement in activities such as internships, externships, field experiences, clinical activities, etc.
 Assisting. Any action that helps another engage in academic misconduct. Examples include, but are not limited to, providing materials or assistance without approval, altering someone’s work, grades or academic records, taking a test/doing an assignment for someone else, compelling acquisition, selling, bribing, paying or accepting payment for academic work or assistance that contributes to academic misconduct, etc.
 Tampering. Interfering with an instructor’s evaluation of work by altering materials or documents, tampering with evaluation tools, or other means of interfering.
 Multiple submissions of work. Using or submitting work completed for another or previous class or requirement, without appropriate disclosure, citation, and instructor approval.
 Unauthorized recording and use. Recording and/or dissemination of instructional content without the express permission of the instructor(s), or an approved accommodation coordinated via Disability Access Services.
To support understanding of what can be included in this definition, the Code further classifies and describes examples of Academic Misconduct, including cheating, plagiarism, assisting and others. See the Code of Student
Conduct for details.
You are expected to do your own work and demonstrate academic integrity in every aspect of this course. Familiarize yourself with the standards set forth in the OSU Code of Student Conduct Section 4.2. You must only access sources and resources authorized by the instructor. You may not show your work to any other current or future students without the instructor’s authorization. If there is any question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is your responsibility to seek clarification and approval from the instructor prior to acting. Violations of these expectations or the Code of Student Conduct will be reported to the OƯice of Student Conduct
and Community Standards. First infractions may result in a zero points for the assignment. Subsequent infractions may result in a failing grade for the course. Harassment of the Instructional StaƯ
As noted above, harassment, or the repeated, persistent, severe, or pervasive actions... directed toward specific individual(s) with the intent or eƯect to harass, harm, or alarm, is prohibited by the Code of Student Conduct.
Examples include flooding, or transmitting a similar message over multiple channels (e.g. email, Teams, Ed Discussion, etc.), having a confrontational tone, being overly demanding, argumentative, making repeated grading appeals (especially when explanatory grading comments were already provided); or demands of a grade adjustment; or public negative comments referring to the instructional staƯ. Such harassment is hurtful and
disruptive to a positive class environment. TAs and instructors have many responsibilities and are often busy helping students. They have graded many projects and have a solid understanding of relational DB design and how to be successful in this course. You can best support the learning process by planning ahead and asking well thought out questions. It is normal for students to feel frustrated or even upset when they have a diƯicult
programming issue, or they received challenging feedback about their work. However, it is not acceptable for students to behave uncivilly when communicating with the instructional staƯ. Please do not harass the
instructional staƯ. Students who are harassing will be given one warning. Sanctions for further misconduct may
include being banned from posting on Ed Discussion/Teams, banned from using oƯice hours, and/or being reported
to the OƯice of Student Conduct. Misconduct is a significant oƯense that could result in academic penalties and
other sanctions, including suspension or expulsion from Oregon State University. Citing code Your citation of others code should include:  URL of your source
 Date you retrieved your source
 Title of the program or application you are using
 Type (eg. source code, application, full program, etc)
 Author name(s) if available

 Code version if available
1. The recommended method is to cite your sources using comments in BOTH a README file AND at the top of your code file. Example: a good citation can be observed on lines 1-5 below:
1 # Citation for the following function: 2 # Date: 12/02/2022 3 # Copied from /OR/ Adapted from /OR/ Based on 4 # (Explain degree of originality)
5 # Source URL: http://www.oregonstate.edu/mysource 6 We also expect you to comment any code that is not your own so that we can see you understand how it works, for example: ## Route handles Update functions for the Customer entity. Any code that is not your own needs to be cited. The code from the class starter apps is not your own code. A snippet of code you copied from StackOverFlow is not your own code. Questions about grades Grading assessments seek to fairly evaluate eƯort and provide feedback on where students may improve (because
there is often room for improvement). Understandably, students may not always agree with how they were graded. Grading deductions are not punitive and arguing about a small number of points is largely counter-productive and if handled unprofessionally can be a violation of the syllabus policy on civility. See the Harassment of the Instructional StaƯ policy for details. As noted in the sections on Maximizing Credit and the Late Policy, this course
has some flexible grading policies on some assignments and most students earn a higher score than would be otherwise possible without such flexibility. Conversely, asking clarifying questions about how to apply feedback and improve future work are highly productive lines of inquiry that are encouraged. The TAs will grade all your submissions, unless otherwise noted. If you have any concerns, contact the grader for
that specific assignment via email as noted in the Where to go for help? Any concerns about grades should be
communicated within 7 days of receiving the grade. If you do not receive a satisfactory response, you may email one of the instructors and state your case. When an instructor re-evaluates your assignment, we reserve the right to assess the entire work in addition to areas you asked for review. If you are not satisfied with the instructor's decision you may petition the EECS Head of the Online Program.
Statement Regarding Students with Disabilities Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval, please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at http://ds.oregonstate.edu. DAS notifies students and faculty members of
approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations. Accessibility of Course Materials All materials used in this course are intended to be accessible. However, resources available through external providers (i.e., YouTube, websites, etc.) may not fully comply with accessibility standards. If you require accommodations please contact Disability Access Services (DAS).
Additionally, Canvas, the learning management system through which this course is oƯered, provides a detailed
page about how the platform is accessible to students with disabilities.
Late Policy You must submit all assignments before the due date, even if it is incomplete! However, if your submission is
incomplete your grade maybe a Zero, unless you follow these instructions. 1. Notify the TA that you plan to resubmit it within 3 days (you can notify them by email or in the Canvas
comment with your submission).

2. If you submit a partial fulfillment of the requirements before the due date and then resubmit a revision within 3 days, your grade will reflect your final submission. If you do not resubmit within 3 days, your grade will reflect your original (potentially incomplete) submission.
3. The exceptions to this are project steps, drafts, draft reviews, extra credit assignments and the final
project step submission(the one that is due in the last week of the term!) ; these must be submitted on
time and cannot be revised once the due date has passed. This is because the entire class is working towards their completion and slipping the due date for one student aƯects the other students who are
required to perform reviews and submit project steps per the schedule.
4. If you do not submit your first version before the due date, you will receive 0 credit. Exceptions may be
made for documented emergencies e.g. hospitalization.
Communication Methods Ed Discussion Ed Discussion should be used for all questions seeking technical help, conceptual help or assignment clarification.
Essentially if it is any sort of information that may benefit other students, it should be posted to Ed Discussion. If there is a question that gets ignored for longer than 48 weekday hours you can email the instructor and TA and ask them to follow up with it. It may have just gotten missed. Look below for the Code Sharing policy. Teams The Teams channel is the primary mode of conducting oƯice hours by the TAs unless specified. At the beginning and
end of each oƯice hour session (whether or not it is held using Teams), the TA would put up a message on the Teams
channel informing so. If you are sharing code on Teams, look below at the Code Sharing policy. Email Any email sent to the instructor about this course must originate with an OSU-issued email account. Email using
the OSU-issued email addresses is the only way we can be certain of your identity (and vice versa). Email should be used for anything that contains sensitive information. So if you have a question about a grade or want to request an extension, do so via email. All emails should have CS340 in the subject so that they get priority in my inbox. In addition, every time you reply to an email thread it knocks it to the back of the queue because email gets processed in order of the most recent emails last. So be careful sending multiple replies as it might bump you back in the queue. Canvas Comments Canvas comments should only be used by students to add commentary prior to grading and by myself and the TAs
to give feedback. If you need to communicate something to myself or the TAs after your assignment has been graded do so via Email. We will not see comments posted to your assignment submission after it has been graded.
Canvas Mail The TAs and myself rarely monitor Canvas email. There are less options to sort and filter mail via that system so there is a much higher likely-hood that we will miss things that get sent via Canvas email. So I suggest you do not
use it. TA OƯice Hours
The primary mode of oƯice hours by the TAs, unless otherwise indicated, will be the Teams channel. At the
beginning and end of each oƯice hour, the TAs will inform on the above Teams channel.
Times are in PDT. Time in PST Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday

Contacting the TAs - Teams To contact Professors or TA, please send a direct message on Teams. Contacting the Instructor OƯice hours with the Instructor are available by appointment.
You can email me at currym@oregonstate.edu if you want to schedule a time on Teams. We very active on Teams
and by email so you can usually reach us there pretty quickly. You should not expect that we will see or respond to messages outside of 9-5 work hours or over the weekend, although we may sometimes. All technical questions, as well as questions about assignments, quizzes, or anything that you learn in class (unless they are related to your grade), should be posted in Ed Discussions so that all students can benefit from them. OSU CS Tutoring Tutoring link: https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/current-students/academic-support
Communication Timelines You can expect a response to emails within 48 weekday hours. So if you send an email at 8am on Monday, you should have a response by 8am on Wednesday. If you send an email at 10pm on Thursday, you should have a response by 10pm on Monday. Do not expect communication on the weekends, though I do my best to look for urgent questions that are preventing you from making progress and answering them, even on the weekend. The more specific the question, the more likely you are to get help. Code Sharing You will not get in trouble for sharing code on Ed Discussion or in Teams in order to solve problems. The communication guide actually mandates that you share portions of your code if you want to ask a good question. If you are worried that you are posting too much code, mark it private and ask me to review it. Note that this is a more permissive policy than the standard policy for the program.
You will get in a great deal of trouble if you copy code without citing it. See the policy on plagiarism. Code from lectures is not your own, code from StackOverflow is not your own, code from the node.js documentation is not your own. If it is not your code you must cite it. If you cite it, you must provide documentation of what it is doing so that I know you understand the code you are using.

Course Policy on the use of AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT or similar software). You are expected to create your own work in this class. When you submit assignments (including assignments, projects, quizzes, or discussions), you are asserting that you have generated and written the text unless you indicate otherwise by the use of quotation marks and proper attribution for the source. You should know that AI tools are based on large collections of text that may have numerous errors, be highly biased and generate answers that are verifiably wrong. For example, a recent study found that 52% of AI responses contain incorrect information and 77%
are verbose. Submitting content obtained from other sources (e.g. ChatGPT, Grammarly, Chegg, and even Google’s autocomplete) as your own (e.g. without clear citations) is cheating and a violation of the Student Conduct Code. You may use simple editing tools to help with syntax, spelling and grammar, but you may not use AI tools to draft your work, even if you edit, revise, or paraphrase it. Do not underestimate our ability to detect the use of AI in your submissions! The penalty for violating the policy is severe. Your work may be flagged as potentially AI generated and reported per the syllabus policy on Academic Integrity for any of the following:  Evidence of a diƯerent writing style from previous work submitted in the course.
 The topics discussed in the submission are not topics covered in class or part of the course.
 The answer for the submission does not directly address the prompt.
 The answer for the submission is vastly outside of the guidelines of the prompt (e.g., word count too high, writing style inconsistent with expectations, etc.).
 The submission is highly similar to a response generated by AI when the assignment prompt is entered in AI.
 Citations provided are fictitious.
Alternatively, AI tools are a valuable resource to help troubleshoot code and can also be used responsibly to supplement and enhance your learning and understanding of course materials. For example you may ask ChatGPT questions that you would otherwise ask the instructor after completing a lecture. E.g. “how is relational algebra used in modern database systems?” "Why does the following code generate the error 'Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails'?" As with other sources (e.g. the course text, Stack overflow, etc.), your use of these is guided by the Academic Integrity Policy and anything you submit that that is not your own must be clearly
cited. Code editor Amount of use: Extensive. Used for the Project and some SQL assignments.
Expected knowledge: Proficient
Coverage in class: Extensive. The Week 1 will cover configuring and editing with VS Code. Subsequent coding
videos will primarily be in VS Code. Examples: Visual Studio Code, Moba Xterm, Atom, Sublime Text, Emacs, Vim or TextWrangler.
Diagramming tool Amount of use: Extensive. Used for drawing all ER diagrams for assignments.
Expected knowledge: Minimal.
Coverage in class: Moderate. The Week 2 material will cover how to use diagramming tools and translating models
into a MySQL schema with sample data. Examples:Draw.io and MySQL Workbench for ER diagrams and PhPMyAdmin for schema diagrams. Other options
include Microsoft Visio for Windows which is available for free for OSU students and.
Moving files Amount of use: Moderate. Used for the Project.
Expected knowledge: Working knowledge
Coverage in class: None. You should be able to upload files to your ENGR directory already. You should also know
how to set permissions on those files. If not the IT Support has a page explaining how to map your file space to your
PC which makes it pretty easy to upload files
Examples: Map ENGR folder to your PC, MobaXTerm or FileZilla
Source code management

Amount of use: Moderate. Used for the Project.
Expected knowledge: Working knowledge
Coverage in class: Minimal. In Week 6 there is a Exploration that covers collaborating with a partner using Git
Examples: GitHub or GitLab.
Personal MySQL Database Description: You will have one College of Enginering assigned MySQL database. However, many students also elect
to download and install MySQL on their own personal computer. One potential advantage is they can have more than one personal database. Having more than one personal database maybe beneficial for completing assignments and the project. Amount of use: Moderate. Potentially used for the Assignments and Project.
Expected knowledge: Working knowledge
Coverage in class: None. If you elect to install MySQL, follow the documentation.
Examples: MySQL Community Installer or XAMPP.
SSH use. Amount of use: Moderate. Used for the Project
Expected knowledge: Working knowledge of Linux commands and command line interface
Coverage in class: Very limited. We expect that you know basic Linux commands to navigate and interact with a file
system. The videos will demo using the CLI. Examples: Accessing UNIX server using PuTTY (SSH) | Information Technology and Computing Support | Oregon
